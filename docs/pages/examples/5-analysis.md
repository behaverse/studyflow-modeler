Scientific research requires systematic and reproducible data analysis workflows. Studyflow diagrams can create comprehensive specifications for end-to-end analysis pipelines.

The flow includes conditional branching for handling different data conditions, integration of multiple analysis branches, manual processing, and documentation of decision rules that guide the analytical process.
