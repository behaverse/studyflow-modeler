Scientific manuscripts require clear visual representations of study designs, workflows, and procedures. Traditional text descriptions and static diagrams are often lengthy, difficult to update, and challenging to adapt for different audiences.

Studyflow diagrams provide a visual, machine-readable specification that generates publication-quality visualizations automatically. By specifying study structure once in studyflow format, researchers can generate consistent, professional figures for manuscripts.

The modular structure of studyflow enables selective rendering of elements, allowing authors to emphasize different aspects of their study design depending on audience and context.

Here is an example that illustrates how a single studyflow specification can be visualized in different ways for publication:

1. as a comprehensive study workflow including all procedural details,
2. as a simplified figure for the main manuscript, and
3. as an interactive figure for online supplements or presentations.
