BPMN

BPMN is a standard language for business process modeling, widely used in healthcare, finance, and logistics to model workflows. BPMN provides 1) a graphical representation of workflows, allowing stakeholders to understand and communicate complex processed easily, and 2) a formal XML-based semantics that enables the execution of BPMN models in various environments.

However, despite its versatile nature, BPMN is generic and is not specifically designed to capture domain-specific semantics like in cognitive science or machine learning. It is extendible though: it can be extended to model specific processes and concepts involved in data-driven scientific experiments: experimental design, data collection, data cleaning and transformation, training models, versioning and deploying models, and so on. 

Studyflow is an extension of BPMN that is specifically designed to model scientific experiments. It provides a formal language to describe the workflow of the experiments, including the design, collection, and modeling phases.
