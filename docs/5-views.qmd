The same studyflow diagram can be viewed in different ways depending on the stakeholder's needs:

- **Study View**: A high-level BPMN-like overview of the study, showing all the components, their relationships, and properties.
- **Timeline View**: A Gantt-like chronological representation of the time-sensitive elements, showing the sequence of tasks and milestones. This view automatically identifies temporal patterns of the workflow, making it easier to manage and report the timeline of the study.
- **Checklist View**: A task-oriented view that lists all the tasks, their corresponding checklist items and status.
