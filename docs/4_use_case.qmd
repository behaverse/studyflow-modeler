# Example Use Case


## CONSORT

CONSORT is a checklist and flow diagram for reporting randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It is designed to improve the quality of reporting in RCTs and to help readers understand the design of RCTs. Studyflow can be used to create a CONSORT flow in a more concise and readable way than traditional box-and-arrow along with text descriptions. Additonally, since the studyflow diagrams are machine-readable, they can also be used to simulate the RCTs (see supplementary materials for a simulation video).

Figure X shows an example of CONSORT flow diagram created in studyflow language. It reads from top to bottom, and the the default format for CONSORT is shown on the right path of diagram. On the left path, the diagram uses more advanced and concise elements to describe the the same flow using error handling events.
