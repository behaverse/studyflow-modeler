# StudyFlow Modeler: A tool to model and run cognitive experiments

Exact description of cognitive experiments is crucial for reproducibility and replicability. Currently, behavioral and cognitive experiments are usually described as texts in scientific papers; sometimes, basic flowchart diagrams accompany those methods sections for improved communications. However, these diagrams are not formal and due their implicit nature cannot be executed. Interpreting those texts and diagrams require specialized knowledge that is not always available to all researchers, making them inaccessible to non-experts and hindering the reproducibility and replicability of the experiments.

StudyFlow is a visual, but formal, language based on BPMN to describe cognitive experiments from start to finish in a way that can be simulated or executed. Here we describe the core elements of StudyFlow and StudyFlow Modeler, a tool to model and run cognitive experiments using the StudyFlow language.
