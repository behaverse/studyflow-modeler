# StudyFlow Modeler: A tool to model and run cognitive experiments

Behavioral and cognitive experiments are usually described in texts in scientific papers. Sometimes, basic flowcharts are used to describe them. However, these flowcharts are not formal and cannot be executed. StudyFlow is a formal language based on BPMN to describe cognitive experiments from start to finish. StudyFlow Modeler is a tool to model and execute cognitive experiments using the StudyFlow language.
