Studyflow is a visual language for defining research workflows and scientific experiments. It builds on <abbr title="Business Process Model and Notation" class="initialism">BPMN</abbr>[**BPMN**: Business Process Model and Notation. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPMN>]{.aside} and adds research-focused components to make it accessible to researchers.


# Basic elements

To get started, it's important to understand its core elements:
[For a detailed overview of the studyflow language, please refer to the [specifications](spec/1-grammar).]{.aside}

:::{.m-4}

**<i class="bi bi-circle"></i>&nbsp; Event**: circles represent the start and end of a study, as well as intermediate events that can trigger actions.

**<i class="bi bi-square"></i>&nbsp; activities**: rectangles represent activities or steps in the study, such as cognitive tests, questionnaires, or instructions.

**<i class="bi bi-diamond"></i>&nbsp; Gateway**: diamonds represent decision points that can alter the flow of the study based on conditions or randomization.

**<i class="bi bi-file-earmark"></i>&nbsp; DataObject**: file-like shapes represent transient data produced or consumed by other elements.

**<i class="bi bi-database"></i>&nbsp; DataStore**: cylinders represent persistent data storage, such as databases. Unlike data objects, data stores retain information beyond the scope of a single study instance.

**<i class="bi bi-arrow-return-right"></i>&nbsp; SequenceFlow**: arrows connect events, activities, and gateways to define the order of elements.

## Graphical notation

Studyflow uses a specific graphical notation to convey the semantics of each element. Different types of activities, for example, can have different icons to indicate their type:

These icons extends the standard BPMN icons. For a complete list, see [*Specifications / Elements*](spec/2-elements.qmd).
