[Behaverse Studyflow](https://behaverse.org/data-model/spec/general/studyflows) is a visual language to describe scientific research in a more formal way than texts or static graphics. It's a format to describe and communicate your research workflow in a clear and unambiguous way.


To get started, check out the [*Getting Started*](getting-started.qmd) page. You can also find information about:

- **Modeler app**: you can use the [*Studyflow Modeler*](https://behaverse.org/studyflow-modeler) app to create and simulate studyflow diagrams.
- **Formal specifications**: main elements of the studyflow for formalizing experimental research.
- **Visual diagrams specifications**: communicate and publish research workflows for better understanding.
- **Execution engine** (experimental): deploy and execute the diagrams.
- **Examples**: some example use cases of studyflow in different scenarios.
