<h1 className="m-8 mx-auto text-4xl font-extrabold text-red-800">About Studyflow Modeler</h1>

*Studyflow Modeler* is an app to describe scientific studies using [Behaverse Studyflow](https://behaverse.org/data-model/spec/general/studyflows), a visual language specifically designed to describe all the steps of a research project in a more formal way than texts or graphics. To provide a familiar foundation for modeling complex research workflows, Studyflow relies on the widely recognized [BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)](https://www.bpmn.org/).

With Studyflow Modeler, you can visually define every step of your study, from initial conception to subject recruitment, data collection, analysis pipelines, and final reporting.

# Elements

The basic elements of the language are tailored to the specific needs of cognitive sciences and include:

- **Study**: The overarching entity that encapsulates the entire research project. It's the top-level container for all components and workflows and extends BPMN:Process class.
- **Start Event** (with consent): Defines the beginning of the workflow. It can be conditioned on participants giving informed consent, supporting the ethical and legal requirements.
- **Instructions**: Define and deliver instructions to the participants.
- **Cognitive Tests**: Various cognitive assessment tasks within the study design, including [Behaverse cognitive tests](https://behaverse.org/projects/cognitive-tests.html).
- **Questionnaires**: Surveys and questions for gathering self-reported data.
- **Video Games**: Interactive games as part of the experimental paradigm.
- **Datasets**: Seamless integration with [Behaverse Data Model (BDM)](https://behaverse.org/data-model) for storing and transforming events, trials, and models.
- **End Event**: Defines the end of the workflow, typically after all the data has been collected. It can redirect to a different workflow or terminate the study.



# Views

The same studyflow diagram can be viewed in different ways depending on the stakeholder's needs:

- **Study View**: A high-level BPMN-like overview of the study, showing all the components, their relationships, and properties.
- **Timeline View**: A Gantt-like chronological representation of the time-sensitive elements, showing the sequence of tasks and milestones. This view automatically identifies temporal patterns of the workflow, making it easier to manage and report the timeline of the study.
- **Checklist View**: A task-oriented view that lists all the tasks, their corresponding checklist items and status.
