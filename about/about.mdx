*StudyFlow Modeler* an app to design cognitive science studies using [Behaverse StudyFlow](https://behaverse.org/data-model/reference/general/studyflow), a visual language specifically designed to formally describe all the steps of cognitive studies. It provides a powerful and intuitive way to formalize your cognitive study designs, fostering clarity, reproducibility, and collaboration within the research community. StudyFlow is based on the widely recognized BPMN2 (Business Process Model and Notation) standard, providing a familiar foundation for modeling complex research workflows.

<br />

With StudyFlow Modeler, you can visually define every step of your study, from initial conception and subject recruitment to data collection, analysis pipelines, and final reporting. The basic elements of the language are tailored to the specific needs of cognitive research and include:

- Start Event (with consent): Defines the beginning of the workflow. It can be conditioned on participants giving informed consent, supporting the ethical and legal requirements.
- Instructions: Define and deliver instructions to the participants.
- Cognitive Tests: Various cognitive assessment tasks within the study design.
- Questionnaires: Surveys and questions for gathering self-reported data.
- Video Games: Interactive games as part of the experimental paradigm.
- BDM-compatible Datasets: Seamless integration with [Behaverse Data Model (BDM)](https://behaverse.org/data-model) for storing and transforming events, trials, and models.
- End Event: Defines the end of the workflow, typically after all the data has been collected. It can redirect to a different workflow or terminate the study.
